    <h2>Space exploration 1.0</h2>
    <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the
        experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable
        than those which divide us.

    <p>It suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and
        my thumb blotted out the planet Earth. I didnâ€™t feel like a giant. I felt very, very small.</p>

            next 10.</p>
